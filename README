This mod allows players to harvest a crop and plant the item the player is holding with a single right-click.

It supports the following crops from mcl_farming and mcl_nether:

* Beetroot
* Carrot
* Potato
* Wheat
* Nether Wart

I have tested it with Mineclonia, so it should work with MineClone2 or MineClone5.
